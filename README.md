My personal website, where I host my portfolio, curriculum vitae and link to the platforms I'm using professionally!

### Shaders
An outline shader is applied, followed by an intensity based circle grid shader.
The outlines are my own depth-buffer only adaptation of Omar Shehata's [WebGL Outlines](https://github.com/OmarShehata/webgl-outlines), licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).
The intensity based circle grid shader is my own.

### All else
Is [my own](https://joebinns.com/).
