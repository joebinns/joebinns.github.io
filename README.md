## Credits
### 2001: A Space Odyssey models
The original [models](http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/addon/addon_516.html) were courtesy of Frank Gregorio via The Celestia Motherlode. The models were then simplified to remove redundant vertices and excessive detailing, to reduce file size.

### Johan Strauss II's "An der sch√∂nen, blauen Donau" (The Blue Danube)
