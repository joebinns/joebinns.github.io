My personal website, where I host my portfolio, curriculum vitae and link to the platforms I'm using professionally!

## Backlog
- Light theme support, automatically detected from browser settings.
- Make canvas background pure black.
- Fix text hover and WebGL for Safari.
- Update project list.
- Swap out placeholder models for 'About', 'Stylised Character Controller', '404' and 'WIP'.
- Optimise model geometries.
- Switch JavaScript from CDN hosting to npm.
- Fade in some audio when models are spinning fast.
