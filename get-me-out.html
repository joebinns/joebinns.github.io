                    Interaction System
                </summary>
                <p>
                    A great escape room needs to make the mundane, like searching through drawers and scanning through documents, feel like an exciting expedition.
                    With the interact system at the heart of Get Me Out's experience, I needed to focus on harvesting tactility and reactivity to the brink.
                    Whilst snappy animation-based buttons and keypads were used, by and large I am most proud of the physics-based hold and grab mechanics.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Holding
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Initial implementations of the hold system involved setting the held object as a child protruded in front of the first person camera.
                    Whilst the approach worked, it felt rigid.
                    Crucially, objects lacked momentum and wouldn't react to their surroundings.
                </p>

                    Thankfully, I have a trick that'll put a spring in any object's step &mdash; Oscillators! As before, I used an empty child protruded in front of the first person camera, although this time to denote the target transform for held objects.
                    I was then able to turn the hold behaviour on or off by simply enabling or disabling the oscillator component.
                    From this simple approach, held objects gain physics-based easing and the ability to be displaced by the environment, whilst also conserving linear momentum &mdash; allowing for objects to be thrown at no extra cost.
                    Adding additional features to the hold system then comes naturally.
                    For instance, the ability to control the distance at which an object is held is then just a matter of manipulating the target transform's local forward position.
                </p>

                    All that's then missing is that objects won't rotate in response to collisions with the environment.
                    This is remedied by doing all the same with a torsional oscillator component.
                    Adding additional features once again comes naturally;
                    the ability to rotate held objects for inspection is just a matter of manipulating the target transform's local rotation.

                <h4>
                    Grabbing
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I distinguished grabbing from holding, as grabbed objects have unique limitations to their motion.
                    For example, we grab desk drawers, which move restricted to a single fixed axis of motion.
                    Additionally, we grab cupboard doors, which rotate along a single axis determined by their hinges, whilst remaining fixed in position.
                    Due to the significant difference in these behaviours, I further subdivided grabbing into it's linear and torsional forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst I was once again able to use oscillators for their responsive physics-based benefits, I soon encountered a new problem at hand.
                    Namely, how could I accurately interpret how the player wants to move or rotate a grabbed object based on mouse input alone?
                    Favouring tactility over the mundane, I decided to try my hand at deriving a look vector based approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the linear case, the problem becomes one of interpreting which point along the fixed axis of motion best represents where the player's looking.
                    After playing around with some ways of using colliders to assist in solving the problem, I landed on more eloquent analytical solutions with better results.
                    The initial analytical solution came from laying a mathematical plane along the fixed axis of motion and finding the point of intersection of the camera's look direction and the plane.
                    The results were much more predictable than with colliders, but still performed poorly in some cases.
                    For instance, whilst a single vertical plane works great from a 'side on' viewpoint, it's a very poor analogue from a 'top down' viewpoint.
                    Introducing multiple planes and sorting them by greatest dot product can help remedy this issue.
                    From a desire for continuous transitions between planes and a maximised dot product, I continued thinking of ways to optimise the solution.
                    I found that substituting the multiple planes for a single plane which is dynamically oriented perpendicular to the camera's look direction worked well.
                    Interpretive problems like this are tricky, too many layers of substitution from the core problem can mean messy results.
                    Thankfully this analytical solution has the best results of anything I've tried.
                    I'd be interested in knowing how other games have approached this problem.

                    The torsional case went through a similar development, but with its own unique problems.
                    My final approach uses a combination of both computational and analytical techniques to interpret the angle around the rotation axis which best represents where the player's looking.
                    First, I center a static sphere collider at the axis of rotation and give it a radius that matches that of the mesh.
                    By raycasting along the look vector, the computed intersection of the look vector and the surface of the sphere can be found and converted to an angle around the axis of rotation.
                    In the case that the look vector doesn't intersect the sphere, it is most important that the converted angle is continuous with the angle on the sphere.
                    I found the analytical intersection of the look vector and a mathematical plane (as finalised with linear grabbing) to perform well in this regard.

                    Character Controller

                <p>
                    Wrote the character controllers movement, crouch, and jump.
                    I am particularly happy with the feel of the crouch and the jump, which came about as a result of the malleable curve-based system which I created.
                </p>
                SHOW THE RESEARCH PAPER WITH THE CLASSIC JUMPS AND HOW CERTAIN JUMPS COULD BE RE-CREATED USING THE CURVE SYSTEM. DISCUSS HOW TO IMPROVE UPON THIS FURTHER.

                <p>
                    I created the Heads-Up Display (HUD) which included a timer, reactive reticle and interaction prompts.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Reactive reticle
                </h4>
                <p>
                    To further draw attention to interactable objects, I implemented a reactive reticle
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Interaction prompts
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Finally, I added interaction prompts to the HUD, which assisted new players in picking up the controls on the fly.
                </p>
